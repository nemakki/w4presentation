        Because of a data loss that took place more than ten years ago, the new restoration contains only a subset of the original Textbase, which was recovered from materials associated Martin Wattenberg’s Spiral. 
        <br><br>
        The work originally would have had more visible stars.
        <br><br>
        To restore the work, Rhizome’s preservation team led by Dragan Espenschied had to build an approximation of Rhizome's API that once had made the Textbase archive accessible, and a software environment for the original Java applet generating the constellations.

        The work would not be existing outside of the Internet context. The work was actually once almost destroyed from the data loss.
        <br><br>
        As seen through the comparison of the original work with itself before the restoration took place, some irreversable damage took place, too.
        <br><br>
        It is an interactive piece that could not evolve without the access of the users, and is almost completely built from the users' actions. It represents interesting dynamics of the community and how interaction takes place.
