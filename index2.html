<p><i>With its use of browser frames, hypertext, and images (both animated and still), My Boyfriend Came Back from the War highlights the parallels and divergences between cinema and the web as artistic and mass mediums, and explores the then-emerging language of the net.</i></p>
<p><i>My Boyfriend Came Back From the War</i> doesn't use a lot of complex elements, yet with the simple html elements, Olia managed to convey a lot of hidden strong emotions and feelings through the back and forth with hyperlinks.
