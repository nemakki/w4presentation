        <i> Olia Lialina came to net art through an interest in cinema. An organizer of Moscow experimental cinema club Cine Fantom, Lialina’s first contact with the net was in 1995, when the group received a computer through a grant from the Soros foundation. She soon started to make an experimental film archive on the web.<br></i>

<p id="starintro"><i>Starrynight</i> was an artwork developed by Alex Galloway, Mark Tribe and Martin Wattenberg in the year of 1999.
    <br><br>
    StarryNight was developed as an artistic interface for the curated, online archive of Rhizome’s email discussion list, an important forum for artists working with new forms of media in the late 1990s.
    <br><br>
    Each week, selected messages from the list—including critical exchanges, sharing resources and information, and artwork in email form—were saved to the archive, which was called Textbase.

<div id="starintrodiv">
    <br>
    In <i>Starrynight</i>, each star represents one archived email that glows stronger as more times the corresponding message was accessed.
